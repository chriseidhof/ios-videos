<p>This is the iOS/Mac/Swift version of <a href="http://pyvideo.org">pyvideo</a>, made by <a href="https://twitter.com/chriseidhof">Chris Eidhof</a> <a href="<%= config[:github_repo_url] %>/graphs/contributors">and friends</a>. It's very much a proof of concept. But let's try to get this thing going! If you have videos to submit, please file a <%= link_to 'pull request', config[:github_repo_url] %>. If you have ideas for how to make this website better, please help out.
